The C programming language doesn't have a built in vector data type. So I created my own. I also created a few vector math functions for them! These datatypes include vector2, vector3, and vector4. I relize the functions will not meet everyones use cases but I tried to write them in a way that could be adjusted easily. You can easily adjust the library to utilize pointers and dynamically allocate memory for the vectors, just adjust for your needs.  

Funtions listed in the header file.
